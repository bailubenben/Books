**comments may mislead you**

    when i was doing the cs231's assignment3, the comments in NetworkVisualization-TensorFlow 
    was not consist with the original paper about saliency maps. i had spending so much energy
    and time tring to implement it. anyway, it taugh me to keep a doubtable attitude to any 
    comments. a sharp eye and smart head are necessary.

**journal comment and commenting-out code**
  
    working in boc, i have seen so many journal comment and commenting-out code existing in 
    the current source file. every time you change the code, they put journal comment at the 
    beginning of the source head. as for commenting-out code, they choose to ignore them. 
    My TM once told me that keep the change smallest. So the file sizes are usually big.
