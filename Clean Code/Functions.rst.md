-functions should be very small
-do one thing
-One Level of Abstraction per Function

-the function and argument should form a very nice verb/noun pair. For example,
write(name) is very evocative.

-Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both. Either your
function should change the state of an object, or it should return some information about
that object.
