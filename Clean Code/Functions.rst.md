**Rules For Function**

1. functions should be very small
2. do one thing
3. One Level of Abstraction per Function
4. Reading Code from Top to Bottom: The Stepdown Rule
5. the function and argument should form a very nice verb/noun pair. For example,
write(name) is very evocative.

6. Functions should either do something or answer something, but not both. Either your
function should change the state of an object, or it should return some information about
that object.
